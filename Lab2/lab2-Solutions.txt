1.a)
CREATE VIEW PopData AS 
SELECT 
CityPops.year,
CityPops.City AS Name,
CityPops.Population,
CityPops.Country,
City.Longitude,
City.Latitude ,
City.Elevation,
Economy.Agriculture,
Economy.Service,
Economy.Industry ,
Economy.Inflation
FROM Citypops,City,Economy
WHERE Citypops.City = City.Name AND Citypops.Country = City.Country AND City.Country = Economy.Country;

1.b) 
View is a virtual table and View is computed each time it is used or accessed. If any content in the table is updated,
it is reflected in the View and it does not require any storage space and is slow. 
Whereas a Materialized View is a physical copy of the query expression. It is stored on the disk and not updated 
each time it is used and thats why it is fast. In our case, we dont run the query several times and compared to big database this is
a small one, so there is no need to use Materialized view.  

2.b) This reasoning is not correct as we might have informantion about a few cities in particular years only, and we might not 
have their information during some years. So we dont have consistent data to say that people are moving from cities to countryside.
